CONNectEasier-Social-Networking
===============================

An application that will allow the user to create a new account and login. 
They will then have the option to post to their timeline, add/join an event, 
view their friends/post to their timeline/see their events, as well as edit their 
friends(add or delete them). I implemented all of the data structures involved 
including the priority queue, linked list, ordered array, and hash table. This project
is still in the works.
